## My process
I started the project delimiting the html with all the tags for after adding the CSS and styling the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I tried to learn the basics of HTML and CSS for a better application in future projects and start with my learning of coding for front end works. 

Learned how to properly use the basics of html and tagging and stylization with CSS basics, how to tag the <div> for a better use of it.

### Continued development

i'll continue to focus on this kind of projects for better understanding the process for learn JS on future.
